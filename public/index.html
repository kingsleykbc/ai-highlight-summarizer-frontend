      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

			Age 28 Steal the formula, upgrade your life Photo by Radek Grzybowski on Unsplash I never thought I’d make a dime from writing online.
			I’ve taken zero courses, didn’t study writing at school, had no mentors, nothing. There were no shortcuts in my journey. Yet, here I
			am making $1.5k a month, writing about whatever I want on the internet. It’s the best feeling in the world. So if you’re sitting there
			thinking ‘I want that’, let me tell you the story of how I got here. The bumbling years (2016–2019) For 3 years I was trying to get
			rich quickly. I’d started a graduate scheme, was underwhelmed by office life, and couldn’t believe that this would be my next 50
			years. I started looking for an escape route. For something more. In January 2017, I consumed everything I could on escaping the rat
			race, finding freedom, building something for myself. It was all procrastination but at least it made me feel better. By March, I
			started to take action. On the wrong things but that’s all part of it. I decided to start a sock store (yes like selling socks online,
			I have no idea what I was thinking).
